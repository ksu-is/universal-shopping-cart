# universal-shopping-cart

## About this project
The universal shopping cart is an application that allows users to add their items into a single cart from multiple websites. It allows users to be more organized with their shopping by having everything in one convenient place. 

Have you ever had a trillion different tabs open all at once containing various shopping carts? I know I personally have had this issue one too many times. You would think in such a modern high tech environment we would have already created a solution to this very problem. However, I have yet to see one successfully designed or adopted. This software could be used by anyone from shopaholics like me to below average consumers. It would allow users to add items across websites to a singular cart to create a seamless and stress free shopping experience.
